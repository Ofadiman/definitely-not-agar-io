## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to become the largest cell on the server. Players move their cell using mouse controls or keyboard keys, allowing for fluid and responsive movement within the game environment. As players consume smaller cells and pellets, their cell grows in size, making it easier to consume larger cells while also becoming a more tempting target for other players.

The gameplay mechanics are straightforward but offer a surprising amount of depth and strategy. Players must constantly balance aggression with caution, as overly aggressive moves can leave them vulnerable to being eaten by larger cells, while overly cautious play may result in missed opportunities for growth.
